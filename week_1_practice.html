            <h2>What is Bouldering</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harness</li>

                <li>Unlike traditional climbing,bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems,"typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</li>

                <li>Experience the perfect blend of <strong>phisical challenge and mental puzzle-solving</strong> as you navigate routes close to the ground,with nothing but a crash pad and determination. </li>
            </ol>
